# Car_Dekho-data-querying


In this project, I've used basic level SQL queries to explore the Database of the  Second Hand Car Dealer Car_Dekho Company.
I used MySQL Workbench application and imported the Excel files to a SQL Database in my local machine to carry forward with the analysis.
The raw dataset was downloaded from a youtube channel called akki motivational-https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MPKiAUKdr1riZ5N_P_qyapXCcb5Jhih_/view

	This database contains details and properties of a Car. 
	The structure has 1 table consisting of 13 columns & 7927 records.
I've used various SQL techniques such as Statements,Clauses,Operators & Functions to analyze the data.
